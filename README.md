The Swine Integrated Omics Database([http://iswine.iomics.pro/](http://iswine.iomics.pro/))

## Overview

[ISwine](http://iswine.iomics.pro/) is an omics knowledgebase for swine that combines genome, transcriptome, quantitative traits and annotation information, and provides an online gene prioritizing platform based on multi-omics data integration by using a machine learning model. In the present version, ISwine houses almost all current published swine genome data, transcriptome data and QTX (Quantitative Trait Loci/Gene/Nucleotide) data which include 825 Re-sequencing individuals, 3,282 RNA-seq samples and 24,238 QTXs. By means of a user-friendly web interface, users can easily browse, search, visualize and prioritizing causal genes. Collectively, ISwine is dedicated to the integration of swine omics data and thus bears great promise to serve as a valuable knowledgebase for worldwide research communities.
